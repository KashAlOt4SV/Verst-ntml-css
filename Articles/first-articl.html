                Welcome to a series; one which could be endless due to the sheer amount of horror experienced by students<br>
                across the UK when it comes to student renting.<br><br>
                As students our innocence goes awfully deep. We are easy targets, wrongly seen as fools who will chuck our<br>
                student loan at anything that says ‘bills included’. This makes us appear easy to manipulate and therefore we<br>
                often wind up being mugged off when it comes to renting.<br>

                        Unfortunately, we’re sometimes greeted with crusty rooms, <br>
                        suspicious stains and rickety furniture. Not to<br>
                        mention the overgrown gardens…

                            There is something about being young and inexperienced <br>
                            that makes landlords and letting agents think we enjoy<br>
                            living in squalor. As though we won’t raise complaints as we<br>
                            are easy-going and placid. As if we thrive when living<br>
                            with rodents. That, as we grow into adults,<br>

                This series is dedicated to and in justice for the unsung inhabitants and their wretched experiences. From vermin<br>
                infestations, cowboy landlords and unstable, mould-covered ceilings. These unlucky folks have seen, felt and<br>
                heard it all…<br>
                The first victims we hear from attend the University of Sunderland.<br><br>

                In a house of seven, these students were still outnumbered by mice. The nooks and crannies meant candles and<br>
                reed diffusers were replaced by mouse traps and poison in each room of the house for a majority of the year.<br>
                Forking out on rent is enough, <b class="color-for-txt">let alone spending their student loan on rodent bait boxes!</b><br><br>

                Sharing many rodent-like features was their landlord. Notoriously intimidating, the residents of this abode lived<br>
                in a permanent state of anxiety by a landlord who alarmed and unnerved them. Even before their morning coffee<br>
                had been poured, you couldn’t feel safe…<br>
                <em>‘The landlord embarrassed one of the tenants in the street…we forgot to put the bins out and the landlord made<br>
                a tenant run after the bin lorry down the street at 7 am…they didn’t even have uni that day!’</em><br><br>

                What’s more, a major leak in the shared bathroom (which, of course, was reported but never repaired) meant the<br>
                ceiling hung in jeopardy over their heads and for a long while the tenants lived in constant fear of collapse. Even<br>
                <em>‘after months of the landlord being aware’</em> in attempts to get the issue fixed, it meant sitting on the toilet or<br>
                taking a long shower could never be as relaxing as it was meant to be.<br><br>

                Your home is meant to be a sanctuary of escapism and comfort. It should take you away from all the stresses and<br>
                the nasties of the outside world. As a result, it isn’t very settling to have maintenance workers stumble into your<br>
                room, whilst you’re asleep and in very minimal clothing. At least they turned up on this occasion! Getting<br>
                someone to fix these problems (not like they ever were properly fixed) was few and far between. Nine times out<br>
                of ten, no one would even turn up to amend the reported issues and so living with mice and unpredictable<br>
                ceilings became the norm for these unfortunate seven.<br><br>

                If only there were a place, like a website or something, where you could publicly out these menacing landlords<br>
                and ominous estate agents to prevent future students facing the same problem…<br><br>
